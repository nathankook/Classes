Project Google Maps App JavaScript

Purpose: In this project you are going to create the functionality and UI for a location based
Map App using Google Maps API

Requirements: You may use glitch or any editor that you prefer. For this project you can use
the JQuery library. You may use lecture slides and the past hw’s for sample code but make sure
to make it your own.

The purpose of this project is to make sure you have an understanding of JavaScript objects,
click events on an element, and how to change properties in elements. Most importantly how to
work with a new/unfamiliar API.
