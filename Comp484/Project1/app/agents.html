      <h3>Agents and their abilities</h3>
      <p>Each agent has four unique abilities: two basic abilities, one signature ability, and an ultimate. These abilities define their role in a team, and understanding how to use them effectively is key to mastering the agent.</p>

      <h4 itemprop="agent">Jett</h4>
      <img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/7325f281-94ff-4c5c-9ac4-147b99363d31/600px-Jett_Artwork.png?v=1727055847972" width="225" height="300" alt="Jett agent picture">
      <ul>
        <li>Role: Duelist</li>
        <li>Nationality: South Korea</li>
        <li>Playstyle: High mobility, hit-and-run tactics, great for players who thrive on fast engagements.</li>
      </ul>
  </div>
      <h5>Abilities Breakdown:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Ability 1: Cloudburst</em></li>
          <ul>
            <li>Description: Instantly throw a projectile that expands into a brief vision-blocking cloud on impact. You can curve the projectile in flight by moving your mouse while holding down the ability key.</li>
            <li>Tactical Use: Use Cloudburst to create temporary cover, allowing Jett to dash into or out of engagements safely.</li>
            <li>Pro Tip: Curve the smoke while mid-air to block the enemy’s vision from unexpected angles, giving you a strategic advantage.</li>
          </ul>
        <li><em>Ability 2: Updraft</em></li>
          <ul>
            <li>Description: Propel Jett upwards into the air.</li>
            <li>Tactical Use: Updraft allows Jett to gain a height advantage, perfect for surprise attacks or repositioning.</li>
            <li>Pro Tip: Combine Updraft with Tailwind (Jett’s dash) for quick aerial engagements or to quickly escape dangerous situations.</li>
          </ul>
        <li><em>Signature Ability: Tailwind</em></li>
          <ul>
            <li>Immediately dash a short distance in the direction Jett is moving.</li>
            <li>Tactical Use: Tailwind is great for aggressive plays like dashing into a bombsite or disengaging from fights when outnumbered.</li>
            <li>Pro Tip: Use Tailwind after getting a pick to reposition quickly and avoid getting traded by an enemy.</li>
          </ul>
        <li><em>Ultimate Ability: Blade Storm</em></li>
          <ul>
            <li>Description: Equip a set of highly accurate throwing knives that deal moderate damage. Headshots are lethal, and kills restore knives.</li>
            <li>Tactical Use: Blade Storm is perfect for eco rounds when you don’t have a weapon. Jett’s mobility combined with the accuracy of her knives makes her a powerful duelist.</li>
            <li>Pro Tip: Save Blade Storm for clutch situations where you need mobility and precision. You can fire knives individually for accuracy or fire all of them at once to overwhelm enemies at close range.</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>

      <h4 itemprop="agent">Sage</h4>
      <img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/7325f281-94ff-4c5c-9ac4-147b99363d31/valorant-agent-sage-full-body-art.png?v=1727057462294" width="225" height="300" alt="Sage agent picture">
      <ul>
        <li>Role: Sentinel</li>
        <li>Nationality: China</li>
        <li>Playstyle: Defensive support, area denial, and healing for the team.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
      <h5>Abilities Breakdown:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Ability 1: Barrier Orb</em></li>
          <ul>
            <li>Description: Equip a barrier that can be placed to create a solid wall, blocking paths or creating cover.</li>
            <li>Tactical Use: Barrier Orb can be used to block off choke points, stall pushes, or boost teammates to elevated positions.</li>
            <li>Pro Tip: Rotate the wall before placing it for optimal coverage. Use it to boost yourself to unexpected locations, giving you a height advantage for holding angles.</li>
          </ul>
        <li><em>Ability 2: Slow Orb</em></li>
          <ul>
            <li>Description: Cast a slowing field that expands upon impact, slowing anyone caught in the area.</li>
            <li>Tactical Use: Throw the Slow Orb into chokepoints to delay enemy pushes, or use it to slow down enemies while you retreat or reposition.</li>
            <li>Pro Tip: Use Slow Orb to slow down planted spikes to give your team more time for a retake. It can also be used to punish aggressive pushes.</li>
          </ul>
        <li><em>Signature Ability: Healing Orb</em></li>
          <ul>
            <li>Description: Heal an ally or yourself over time.</li>
            <li>Tactical Use: Healing Orb can sustain your team during longer fights, keeping key players alive during engagements.</li>
            <li>Pro Tip: Save Healing Orb for teammates who are anchoring a site or playing an important role in a retake, rather than healing too early.</li>
          </ul>
        <li><em>Ultimate: Resurrection</em></li>
          <ul>
            <li>Description: Revive a fallen ally with full health.</li>
            <li>Tactical Use: Use Resurrection strategically in crucial rounds to bring back teammates and turn the tide in your favor.</li>
            <li>Pro Tip: Make sure the area is clear before resurrecting an ally, as the resurrection animation leaves both you and your ally vulnerable for a moment.</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>
