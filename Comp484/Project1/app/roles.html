    <h3>Agent Roles</h3>
    <p>Valorant features four primary roles that define how agents contribute to their team. Understanding these roles is key to building a well-rounded team and achieving victory. Each role has a distinct playstyle and set of responsibilities, and agents within these roles are equipped with abilities that help them excel in specific situations.</p>

      <dd>
        <a href="#duelist-section" accesskey="d" itemprop="role">Duelists</a> are the self-sufficient fighters and primary aggressors of the team. Their abilities are designed to initiate fights, take on enemies head-on, and secure kills. Duelists are expected to lead the charge, creating space for their team by eliminating opponents or drawing attention away from their allies.</dd>
      <h4>Playstyle:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Aggressive: Duelists are often the first to engage the enemy, taking duels in key areas.</li>
        <li>High mobility: Many duelists have abilities that allow them to reposition quickly or outmaneuver enemies.</li>
        <li>Self-sufficient: They typically rely less on their team for support, as their kits are built for winning 1v1 engagements.</li>
      </ul>
      <dt>Sentinels</dt>

      <dd>
        <a href="#sentinel-section" accesskey="s" itemprop="role">Sentinels</a> are the defensive backbone of a team, specializing in locking down areas of the map and protecting teammates. Their abilities are focused on delaying or preventing enemy pushes, healing allies, and providing utility to support their team during engagements.</dd>
      <h4>Playstyle:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Defensive: Sentinels often play from the backlines, watching key angles or bomb sites.</li>
        <li>Supportive: They excel at providing utility for their team, whether through healing, reviving, or placing traps to prevent enemy flanks.</li>
        <li>Area Control: Sentinels are experts in controlling small areas of the map, often using abilities that slow or block enemy movements.</li>
      </ul>

      <dd>
        <a href="#controller-section" accesskey="c" itemprop="role">Controllers</a> excel at managing sightlines, creating opportunities for their team to take control of key areas. They use smokes, slows, and other utility to cut off enemy vision, control the pace of the game, and shape how engagements unfold.</dd>
      <h4>Playstyle:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Tactical: Controllers play a key strategic role, setting up plays for their team by controlling vision and access to important areas.</li>
        <li>Map Control: By blocking off enemy sightlines or delaying their advances, Controllers dictate the flow of the match.</li>
        <li>Supportive: While not always aggressive, Controllers play a pivotal role in team coordination and executing strategies.</li>
      </ul>
      <dt>Initiators</dt>

      <dd>
        <a href="#initiator-section" accesskey="i" itemprop="role">Initiators</a> are responsible for breaking through enemy defenses and setting up their team for success. Their abilities are designed to gather intel, disrupt enemy positions, and initiate teamfights. Initiators are critical for gaining control of contested areas and clearing out entrenched enemies.</dd>
      <h4>Playstyle:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Disruptive: Initiators often use their abilities to force enemies out of cover or disrupt their positioning, making it easier for their team to follow up.</li>
        <li>Team-Oriented: Initiators typically work closely with Duelists or Controllers to start engagements and create openings for the team.</li>
        <li>Intel Gathering: Many Initiators have abilities that reveal enemy positions or clear key areas, giving their team critical information before committing to a push.</li>
