# Comp 484 - Project 1

Purpose: In this project you are going to create the HTML and CSS for a website

Requirements: Your project will consist of 5 main files: 4 HTML documents
and 1 CSS document. The CSS file should contain the main style and formatting of the project.You may use glitch or any editor that you prefer. For this project no use of libraries or automated CSS code-generation will be allowed. I want you to come up with the structure of your site and write the HTML and CSS that you feel fits that style. You may use lecture slides and the past
hwâ€™s for sample code but make sure to make it your own. 

The purpose of this project is to create a personal site about one of your interests. Examples include but are not limited to: favorite movie, show, book, artist, band, genre, sport, team, person, place to visit, etc. Be as creative as you wish. If you have other ideas for your site we can further discuss in class. Review lecture material and make proper use of the elements, properties, and CSS covered. All elements and attributes are available for you to use.
